# PostgreSQL MCP - Product Context

## Product Purpose
PostgreSQL MCP bridges the gap between AI agents and PostgreSQL databases by providing a standardized Model Context Protocol interface. This allows agents to interact with databases using a consistent set of tools and operations without needing to understand the underlying database implementation details.

## User Personas

### AI Agent Developers
- Need to enable database operations in AI agents
- Require simplified and consistent database interaction patterns
- Want to avoid passing raw SQL through their agents
- Need safety measures to prevent harmful database operations

### Database Administrators
- Need controlled access to database operations
- Want validation and security checks before execution
- Require monitoring and management of database connections
- Need to limit the scope of possible operations

### Application Developers
- Need to integrate AI capabilities with database operations
- Want a standardized interface for database access
- Require connection pooling and resource management
- Need type-safe database operations with proper error handling

## Use Case Scenarios

### Data Query and Analysis
- AI agents querying database information to answer user questions
- Structured data retrieval based on user requirements
- Data transformation and formatting for presentation

### Database Management
- Creating tables and schemas through a controlled interface
- Managing indexes for performance optimization
- Schema exploration and documentation

### Data Manipulation
- Safe insertion of new records based on validated input
- Controlled updating of existing records
- Selective deletion with proper validation

## Workflow Integration

### Agent Workflow
1. Agent connects to PostgreSQL MCP
2. Agent registers database connection
3. Agent performs operations using connection ID
4. Results are returned in standardized format
5. Agent unregisters connection when finished

### Development Workflow
1. Developer configures MCP service in their environment
2. Developer writes agent code using MCP tools
3. Operations are validated and executed safely
4. Results are processed by the agent
5. Errors are handled appropriately

## Product Constraints

### Security Constraints
- SQL validation limits the types of operations that can be performed
- No direct database connection string access after registration
- Operations are limited to those explicitly implemented
- No arbitrary SQL execution

### Performance Constraints
- Connection pooling for efficient resource management
- Asynchronous operation for better scalability
- Proper resource cleanup to prevent leaks

### Technical Constraints
- PostgreSQL-specific implementation
- Rust language environment
- Requires MCP-compatible client

# PostgreSQL MCP - Active Context

## Current Project State
The PostgreSQL MCP project is an operational implementation of the Model Context Protocol for PostgreSQL databases. The core functionality is complete, with comprehensive test coverage and two operational modes (stdio and SSE).

## Key Components and Their Status

### Connection Management
- **Status**: Complete
- **Features**:
  - Registration of database connections with unique IDs
  - Connection pooling for efficient resource usage
  - Unregistration of connections when no longer needed

### Query Operations
- **Status**: Complete
- **Features**:
  - SELECT query execution with JSON result formatting
  - SQL validation before execution
  - Error handling and reporting

### Data Manipulation
- **Status**: Complete
- **Features**:
  - INSERT operations for adding new records
  - UPDATE operations for modifying existing records
  - DELETE operations for removing records

### Schema Operations
- **Status**: Complete
- **Features**:
  - CREATE TABLE operations
  - DROP TABLE operations
  - Table description (schema information)
  - List tables in schema

### Index Operations
- **Status**: Complete
- **Features**:
  - CREATE INDEX operations
  - DROP INDEX operations

### Type Operations
- **Status**: Complete
- **Features**:
  - CREATE TYPE operations for PostgreSQL custom types

### Transport Modes
- **Status**: Complete
- **Features**:
  - stdio mode for direct process communication
  - SSE mode for web-based clients

## Current Focus
The project is currently focused on:
1. Integration with AI agent systems that utilize the MCP protocol
2. Performance optimization for large datasets
3. Enhanced security measures for database operations
4. Documentation and examples for common use cases

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Enhance error reporting with more detailed information
2. Add support for more PostgreSQL-specific features (e.g., stored procedures)
3. Implement monitoring and metrics for connection usage
4. Create more comprehensive examples showing integration with AI agents
